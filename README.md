# Ritmos
This is an app to use for swimming and running trainning. You can calculate the paces for a specific distance, and also use the chronometer.
In the app, it is also possible to save the favourite paces to compare them in the future.
It is a basic app as it was used to learn Android in my own.

The app in the play store can be found in: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=soloviev.perez.vicente.ritmos2
